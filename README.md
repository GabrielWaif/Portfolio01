# First Portfolio

I decided to create my first portfolio to display my most recent projects and show my evolution as a developer. This was built using base HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS without using any templates.

## Instalation

1. Clone the repository in a new folder.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GabrielWaif/Portfolio01.git
```

2. Open the index.html file to view a local version of the site.

## Explanations

The site is divided into 4 main containers:

1. Home

This container is the landing view of the user so I wanted to give it a little bit of personality, so I used the palette of colors from my keyboard the Nuphy air.

2. Projects 

Here is the main part of the Portfolio, I decided to invert the colors from the Home container giving this part a shock factor.

Hovering the mouse on the project cards triggers an animation that displays a small description for each project and a link for the GitHub Pages and GitHub.

3. About me 

The about me is a complementary section to the resume that tries to give a feel of the type of person that I am and the technologies that I am most comfortable with.

4. Contact 

Finishing with the contact form. Because this is 100% front-end the form functionality was used from an API named "Form submit", this API seems to have some optimization problems, so you may experience a 2 to 5 seconds delay when the send button is clicked.
